Then the data goes to another program that obtains the JSON file. After that file goes to the friends_map.py. That module works with the file and creates HTML file.
After all the work you get into this map. You can see the markers(friends of inputed nickname) that have an information about name and where the markes are. Moreover, you can turn on or turn off the markers in the map in the right top corner of page.
